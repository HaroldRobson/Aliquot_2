    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project aimed to explore seqeunces defined by repeatedly applying the function S defined by:\n",
    "$$S(n) = \\sum_{i<n \\: i|n }^{}i$$\n",
    "We found that whilst most of these sequences terminate at 0 (eg [49, 8, 7, 1, 0]) some enter into loops (such as [...6, 6...] and [...220, 284, 220...]). Some sequences are unkown and do not seem to terminate but the numbers soon exceed the limitations of today's computers. The Json file behaviour20000.json contains these behaviours of all numbers up to 20000 (but more on that later). We first used gmpy2 as our library of choice for performing the computationally expensive calculations necessary, however it turns out that our numbers never grew past 64 bits and gmpy2 was not only unnecessary but also siginificantly (about five times) slower than numpy. Later on we made a similar mistake when a switch to parallel multi-core computing using concurrents.futures resulted in us losing the ability to pass data between functions (such as onlyprimes) and was in fact *slower* than single threaded python! It seems the simple ways are always the best.  "

    "## Question 4\n",
    "This question was done with two methods. The aim was to defifne the sequence behaviour for all numbers less than 20000. We decided to store this data as a .json for easy reuse later. The first method involved redefining S and detect_aliquot_sequence_behaviour to be used with the concurrents.future library for multithreading. This required functions which share no data with each other - our previous functions using the caches would be of no use. The performance gains from concurrents.future were insufficient to offset those lost by the return to functions without global variables:\n",
    ">(note that a peculiarity of multithreading in a notebook is the fact that all functions have to be imported from a separate file so please ensure multithreaded_dependencies.py is in the same folder as this notebook)"
